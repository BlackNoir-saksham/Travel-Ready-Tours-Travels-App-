          Discover astonishing views of the rugged natural landscape from your
          private suite. Each room features graceful furnishings, a
          “Rolls-Royce” sleep experience by Simmons and exceptional design
          inspired by nature.Luxury at 11,000 feet is no mean feat! The increase
          in the number of tourists to Leh, including those who like to travel
          on a shoestring budget as well as those who are expense agnostic, has
          resulted in a surge in the number of luxury hotels in the area. Unlike
          popular perception, Leh can be an ideal destination for families
          looking for a unique experience with oodles of comfort thrown in. You
          can choose from some luxurious hotels such as the Ladakh Himalayan
          Retreat, Saboo Resorts, The Druk Ladakh or more. High on comfort,
          these hotels blend signature Ladakhi hospitality with modern day
          facilities.

          Experience modern local dishes and breathtaking views at our
          awe-inspiring restaurant, Metsovo 1350m. Another of our outstanding
          spaces, The Pines, has two distinctive fireplaces, perfect for
          enjoying some exquisite malts and cigars. The experience continues in
          the Lobby Café where light meals, snacks and beverages are served
          throughout the day.So yes, eating is ephemeral, but some experiences
          are so extraordinary they are worth it for their own sakes. Life is
          not just about such peak moments but it is very much enriched by them.
          ‘Mere experiences’ can also provide a kind of first-hand knowledge of
          the heights to which skill, flair and determination can take us.
          Perhaps it doesn’t matter which of the myriad forms of human
          excellence we most enjoy. Frantzén actually started out as a
          professional footballer for the top Swedish club, AIK Stockholm,
          before injury ended his career at the age of 20. I wondered whether he
          agreed that excellence is the thing that matters, not its particular
          vessel. He nodded in agreement, saying, ‘It happened to be cooking
          now, it could have been anything.’
